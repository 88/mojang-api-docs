### Request
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Endpoint 1:** `/user/profiles`
- **Endpoint 2:** `/user/profiles/agent/minecraft`

- **Full URL 2:** `https://api.mojang.com/user/profiles/agent/minecraft`
- **Headers:**
    - `Authorization: Bearer [JWT/auth token here]`

You must have answered your security questions described in the Security Question-Answer Flow article in order to use this endpoint.

### Response
**200: OK**

No errors were encountered when fetching your profile information. Sample response:

```json

  }
]
```

**401: Unauthorized**

This error occurs when you either haven't answered your security questions, or when you've passed an invalid or expired Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```json
{
  "error" : "UnauthorizedOperationException",
  "errorMessage" : "User not authenticated"
}
```
