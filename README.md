# [Mojang API Documentation](https://mojang-api-docs.netlify.app)
**Note:** I've become quite busy with other things and haven't had the time I want to dedicate to updating these docs. I just released a new update, but the next update won't be for a while. Please contribute if you have the time, any contribution is greatly appreciated!

I'm sure this isn't complete. I know that there are old endpoints I've neglected to document, but that's because they no longer function (e.g old name change, block / reserve name, create Mojang account, redeem voucher (old), etc). **Even then**, I may have missed an endpoint or mistakenly documented something. We all make mistakes, we're human after all. If I did make a mistake documenting something or something's changed since I last updated the docs, please don't hesitate to reach out and let me know via GitHub issue!

Thanks to Luke especially for forking over the cash to purchase new copies of Minecraft for testing purposes.

This documentation is open-source, so feel free to contribute and add more endpoints / information that you find.

Best wishes & warmest regards!
