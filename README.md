# [Mojang API Documentation](https://mojang-api-docs.netlify.app)
**NOTE:** I've become extremely busy over the last while. Looking to hopefully get a chance to push out new fixes and changes within the next few weeks. Please bear with me, sorry again! As always, if something isn't documented correctly or isn't documented at all, please don't hesitate to make an issue on this repository so that I can include it in the next update. Thanks!

I'm sure this isn't complete. I know that there are old endpoints I've neglected to document, but that's because they no longer function (e.g old name change, block / reserve name, create Mojang account, redeem voucher (old), etc). **Even then**, I may have missed an endpoint or mistakenly documented something. If this is the case don't hesitate to reach out and let me know.

This documentation wouldn't be possible without the following people:

- Elias
- LukeTheHacker
- nx
- HX7
- Dusks
- tanpug
- courtier
- Mary
- danktrain

If I missed your credit, reach out. I want to give credit where credit is due.

Thanks to Luke especially for forking over the cash to purchase new copies of Minecraft for testing purposes.

This documentation is open-source, so feel free to contribute and add more endpoints / information that you find.

Best wishes & warmest regards!
